# Installation: needed to download anaconda, create an environment called tf, and in it
# did nltk.download() in the terminal
# then I downloaded the things that weren't properly downloading, like punkt and omw 1.4
# then it worked
# NOTE: for intents[1]: set up a conditional and have a list of pokemon game names. if any of those words
# or key words (probably faster?) is in that list, then no need to ask a follow up question. if there 
# is no name in the input, then ask a follow-up question ("Which game would you like to check?")

#NOTE: for intents[0]: set up a conditional that asks for the region (if a region isn't specified, or rather it's either national, a region is there, no region is there and not national)
